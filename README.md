- 💥 Hi, I’m @jocarrojas
- 👀 I’m interested in programming, music, reading, writing, learning, astronomy, science, physics, sowing, philosophy, history, anthropology, FLOSS and liberation 🕷️🌹.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Full Stack Development with The Odin Project
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the world. Using Github only during learning. I hope to migrate later to a FLOSS alternative like Gitlab.
